# Redacted
A simple Chrome extension that allows you to filter words from the internet a la government redaction style (thick black lines).

The plugin is a bit slow for now as it must loop through every node in the page. Shorter pages will obviously run faster.

### Known Bugs:

* If you add a word the page refreshes, and adding a new word after page refresh will not cause a subsequent refresh.
